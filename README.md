# About

This application is a recruitment task for Ruby on Rails workshops.

Task was to create a simple Rails app to store anonymous citation/quotes. Login or user accounts were not required, just two views:
- view of all citations on index page (starting one)
- view to add single citation
- optional: add possibility to add comments to citations.

Gems used:
- simple_form 4.1.0 
- bootstrap-sass 3.4.0
